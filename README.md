# ChromeExtension_SimpleSearchResults

This Chrome Extension makes google searches simple & AI-free. It is currently pending approval as a public extension, but I wanted to make it available since a part of me doubts they will approve it. 

By using declarative_net_request rules, the extension filters urls on google.com/search and adds query paramater udm=14. This defaults to the simple web results, and if you need to see AI results or contextual questions/answers google shows, you can easily hit the "all" tab for that paticular query. The extension does not record, collect, store, or share *any* data. 

I was frustrated to find out that Google doesn't provide a simply toggle switch to allow the user to control the experience. I shouldn't have to manually add "-AI" to every search, and I wanted an easier way to update browsers on multiple devices instead of creating an alias or other alternative solutions. AI is a tool, and like any tool, it's incredibly useful, but I get to decide what tools I use & when lol not Google. Shame on them for force-feeding AI to the users.

Here is a screenshot to demonstrate the difference in search results with and without the extension installed:

###### The reason I made this extension:
This extension was partially made out of spite. I replaced my phone with a dumb phone since I was getting tired of dopamine overload, doom scrolling, and inflating wealth for tech broligarchs by spending time on their apps. In the heat of the moment, quickly googled if a cheap $80 model at best-buy could hot-spot so I would be able to use a computer or other phone in a pinch if I needed maps or some other complex app. Good news, the AI results confidently told me that it could hot-spot and users loved that among other things... psych!! The closest thing the phone has to hot spot is an FM radio LOL and while I do love listening to FM 91.1 jazz over spotify, I probably would have chosen a different model if I had spent the extra minute to confirm the AI results. And I get it, that's on me, but what the fuck is the purpose of AI results if it's not 100% accurate 100% of the time? If I need to double check every result (or randomly check as QA) then that entirely defeats the purpose and now it feels like I've become a google employee
