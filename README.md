# ChromeExtension_SimpleSearchResults

This Chrome Extension makes google searches simple & AI-free. It is currently pending approval as a public extension, but I wanted to make it available since a part of me doubts they will approve it. 

By using declarative_net_request rules, the extension filters urls on google.com/search and adds query paramater udm=14. This defaults to the simple web results, and if you need to see AI results or contextual questions/answers google shows, you can easily hit the "all" tab for that paticular query. The extension does not record, collect, store, or share *any* data. 

I was frustrated to find out that Google doesn't provide a simply toggle switch to allow the user to control the experience. I shouldn't have to manually add "-AI" to every search, and I wanted an easier way to update browsers on multiple devices instead of creating an alias or other alternative solutions. AI is a tool, and like any tool, it's incredibly useful, but I get to decide what tools I use & when lol not Google. Shame on them for force-feeding AI to the users.

Here is a screenshot to demonstrate the difference in search results with and without the extension installed:

*You can still trigger the main results that include AI overviews or other information by clicking the "all" tab on the left, without disabling the entire extension.*

###### The reason I made this extension:
I got bamboozled by AI search results, so this extension was partially made out of spite. My phone broke recently, so I was borrowing my partners old one as I researched replacements. I've been getting tired of dopamine overload, doom scrolling, and inflating wealth for tech broligarchs by spending time on their apps so I decided that a dumb phone was a better solution than spending money to increase someone elses wealth further exchange for my happyness and existential well-being. So, in the heat of the moment, I found the cheapest model on best buy, quickly googled some reviews and if it could hot-spot so I would be able to use a computer or other phone in a pinch if I needed maps or some other complex app. Great news, the AI results confidently told me that it could hot-spot and users loved that among other things...  Well, it shouldnt suprise you that the closest thing the phone has to hot spot is an FM radio LOL and while I do love listening to FM 91.1 jazz over spotify, and I can feel morally superior to everyone else on the bus by doing so, but I probably would have chosen a different model if I had spent the extra minute to confirm if the AI was hallucinating, or as we always called it, tripping balls. And I get it, that's on me, I'm a lazy piece of shit who trusts whatever he's told at face value, but what the f*ck is the purpose of AI results if it's not 100% accurate 100% of the time? If I need to double check every result than doesn't that defeat the entire purpose in the first place? Anyways, if google sends me $80 I'll delete this extension and pledge allegiance to Gemini.
